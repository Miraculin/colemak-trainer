#Colemak Layout Trainer
A simple CLI-based colemak trainer implemented in Python. The current error metric is absolute number of incorrect words.

#TODO
* different error metric, probably Levenshtein distance
* command-line parameters to control length, number of words and home row only
* quick redo last set

#Maybe implement
* history of incorrect words
* GUI
..* Graphs showing progress over time
